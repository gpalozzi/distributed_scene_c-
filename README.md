# 3D Scene Synchronization for Collaborative Modelling
â€¨Developed a prototype for a realtime modelling software which allows multiple 3D artists to perform concurrent changes on the same 3D model. Realised through a distributed system and efficient algorithms, calculating differences between two versions of a model.
